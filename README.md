## Project Description

My submission for project 2 of CS 140. We are tasked to create a multi-threaded file server that
can handle user input and file operations asynchronously. The required file operations are `write`,
`read`, and `empty`.

## Build Description

file_server.c is stable given the following (personal) environment:<br>
    - OS/Kernel: Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-142-generic i686) <br>
    - Compiler: gcc version 4.8.4. <br>
    - Processor: Multi-core <br>
    
 Execute `make clean && make` to compile the program.
